                    She felt confused when the situtaion happens, then down for finding solution with extra money.
                    But she feels excited when she knows there are apps to help he. The excitement turns to disapointment because of overwhelming apps and of not finding suitable solutions for her situation. Later, she gets ToolShare which helps her to find solution for free or resonable price.
